# WisTex Public License
An open-source license somewhere between MIT and GPL.

One of the biggest challenges with licensing open source software is that some licenses, like the MIT license, are too permissive, while some licenses, such as the GPL are too restrictive. This license is designed to clarify terms of use while maintaining open source freedoms.

## The License - Version 0.1

Copyright < YEAR > < COPYRIGHT HOLDER >

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

You cannot re-release this work under a more restrictive license, however, it may be re-released under a new version of the WisTex Public License. Changing licenses does not affect the license of code released before the change.

If you make changes to the core code or documentation, you shall share and make the source code available to others under this license, either by providing a download link or linking to a code repository or including it with the software or another common method of distributing source code. Any changes you make and the resulting source code shall be made freely available to the maintainers of the software and to the public without charge.

Third party libraries shall not be considered part of this software, and therefore not subject to this license, as long as they are separated and identified as sperate libraries. The licenses of these libraries may not change or interfere with this license.

If the script has a separate templating, theme, plugin, addon, extension, hook, or similar system that allows modifications of the output of the script without modifying the core code, components that are part of such a system (and do not modify the core code) are considered separate works and may be released under this or other licenses, on the condition that nothing in that license may modify or interfere with the license for the core code.

If you modify the core script to work with a component that is considered a separate work, such modifications should be made in such a way where the software will continue to operate without that component. However, if a component is necessary for the operation of the core script, it must be licensed under this license and shared with the core script. 

If a website combines multiple scripts on a website, simply linking from one script to another or using a common theme or template shall not constitute "one work" and each work may be licensed separately. The act of using an API or accessing a common database by another work shall not constitute combining scripts.

Any changes to this script are subject to this license and shall be licensed under this license.

If this script's core code is combined with other scripts in such a manner to create a "new work," and the other scripts already have different licenses, code provided from this script will be considered a seperate work for purposes of licensing and still be subject to this license. Specifically, if the other license has additional restrictions, those restrictions do not apply to the code provided by this script. 

If different licenses apply to different parts of the combined script, you must disclose this to your end users and to people who obtain the source code. If the scripts are combined in such a way where it is unclear which license applies to a particular piece of code, the entire "new work" must be available for license under this license.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
