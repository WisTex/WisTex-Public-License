# WisTex Public License (WPL)
An open-source license somewhere between MIT and GPL.

One of the biggest challenges with licensing open source software is that some licenses, like the MIT license, are too permissive, while some licenses, such as the GPL are too restrictive. This license is designed to clarify terms of use while maintaining open source freedoms.

One key feature is that it attempts to deal with incompatible licenses, and prohibits additional restrictions from being applied the code. Additionally, it provides a workaround when combined with a script with an incompatible license.

## The License - Version 0.1

Copyright < YEAR > < COPYRIGHT HOLDER >

### Permissions

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

### Attribution

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

### Sharing

If you make changes to the core code or documentation, you shall share and make the source code available to others under this license, either by providing a download link or linking to a code repository or including it with the software or another common method of distributing source code. Any changes you make and the resulting source code shall be made freely available to the maintainers of the software and to the public without charge.

### Licensing of Copies and Deriviative Works

Any changes to this script are subject to this license and shall be licensed under this license. Any derivative works shall be licensed under this license.

You cannot re-release this work under a more restrictive license, however, it may be re-released under a new version of the WisTex Public License. Changing licenses does not affect the license of code released before the change.

### Your Contributions

Any code that you or your team personally create still belongs to you and you may use code that you personally created in any way you see fit, including releasing your code under a different license or using your code in other scripts.

When combined with this script, you must release your modifications with this script under this license, but nothing prevents you from using code you personally created in other projects or scripts.

### Code Not Covered by this License

Third party libraries shall not be considered part of this software, and therefore not subject to this license, as long as they are separated and identified as sperate libraries. The licenses of these libraries may not change or interfere with this license.

If the script has a separate templating, theme, plugin, addon, extension, hook, or similar system that allows modifications of the output of the script without modifying the core code, components that are part of such a system (and do not modify the core code) are considered separate works and may be released under this or other licenses, on the condition that nothing in that license may modify or interfere with the license for the core code.

If you modify the core script to work with a component that is considered a separate work, such modifications should be made in such a way where the software will continue to operate without that component. However, if a component is necessary for the operation of the core script, it must be licensed under this license and shared with the core script. 

If a website combines multiple scripts on a website, simply linking from one script to another or using a common theme or template shall not constitute "one work" and each work may be licensed separately. The act of using an API or accessing a common database or datastore by another work shall not constitute combining scripts.

### Combined Works with Multiple Licenses

If this script's core code is combined with other scripts in such a manner to create a "new work," and the other scripts already have different licenses, code provided from this script will be considered a seperate work for purposes of licensing and still be subject to this license. Specifically, if the other license has additional restrictions, those restrictions do not apply to the code provided by this script. 

If different licenses apply to different parts of the combined script, you must disclose this to your end users and to people who obtain the source code. 

If the scripts are combined in such a way where it is unclear which license applies to a particular piece of code, the entire "new work" must be available for license under this license, except in cases of incompatible licenses.

### Combined Works with Incompatible Licenses

An incompatible license is a license that attempts to assert legal control over this script or otherwise adds additional restrictions on this use of this script.

Combining this script with another script with an incompatible license does not release your obligations under this license.

If you combine scripts that have different licenses and both licenses assert authority of the combined work, any code you personally create must be released under this license, and if required by that other license, be released under that license too.

1. Code from this script continues to be licensed under this license, even when combined with another work.
2. Code from the other script continues to be license under their license.
3. Changes that you or your team make to the combined code is considered your work, and is subject to both licenses.

If it is not possible to license the resulting combined script with this license due to provisions in the other license, an alternative is to submit every change you or your team personally make to the maintainers of this script and/or to the public so that it may be incorporated in this script under this license. 

Code that is licensed under a different license does not have to be released under this license, but any changes you or your team make must be released under this license.
